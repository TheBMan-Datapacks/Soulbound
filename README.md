# Soulbound
A Soulbound Items datapack in vanilla 1.13

I am currently in version 1.0, but will update the pack some according to feedback. This is not my main project, so I will not be doing a 
whole ton of work on it once I am done.

This was created to help test the program "dManager" by Stevertus, and that means that for now I am going to keep it there. If you want
to play the pack, please download it from dManager. I will leave a link once it goes live

HOW TO USE:

To start, you will need to kill the wither and obtain the nether star. 1 nether star is required per item.

You need to drop any item and a nether star together on top of this structure:

Then the nether star will disapear and the item will become 'soulbound'
A soulbound item will reappear in your inventory after you die, so you never lose it.
